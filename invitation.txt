Due to number restrictions imposed by our venue, we've made the difficult decision not to invite children to our wedding. We hope that this advanced notice means you can still come and help us celebrate.

The most important thing is to have you with us on our special day. No gifts are needed or expected, however we have been aksed what we need or would like. If you do wish to give us something, a little cash to start our new life together would be very much appreciated.
